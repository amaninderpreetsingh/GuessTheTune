# Important: Spotify Redirect URI Security Requirements

## Why 127.0.0.1 Instead of localhost?

Spotify has strict security requirements for redirect URIs. According to their documentation:

### Requirements:
1. ‚úÖ **Use HTTPS** for redirect URIs (unless using loopback address)
2. ‚úÖ **For loopback addresses**, use explicit IPv4 (`127.0.0.1`) or IPv6 (`[::1]`)
3. ‚ùå **localhost is NOT allowed** as a redirect URI

### What This Means for GuessTheTune

**In Your Spotify App Settings:**
- ‚úÖ Correct: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/callback`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`

**In Your .env Files:**
```env
# Server .env
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/callback
CLIENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000

# Client .env
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Accessing the App

When you run the app, you can access it using either:
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000` ‚úÖ (preferred, matches Spotify config)
- `http://localhost:3000` ‚úÖ (also works in browsers)

Both resolve to the same local server, but Spotify's OAuth flow requires the explicit IP address.

### Why This Security Measure?

Spotify enforces this to:
1. **Prevent DNS hijacking** - localhost can be manipulated via hosts file
2. **Ensure explicit loopback** - 127.0.0.1 is guaranteed to be the local machine
3. **Security best practice** - More secure for OAuth flows

### Production Deployment

For production, you'll use HTTPS:
```env
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback
```

HTTPS is required for non-loopback addresses.
