# Next Steps to Get GuessTheTune Running 🚀

All the code is ready! Here's what you need to do to start playing:

## 1. Install Dependencies

Run this command from the root directory:

```bash
npm run install-all
```

Or install manually:

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

## 2. Set Up Spotify Developer App

1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Create a new app
3. Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/callback` (Spotify requires 127.0.0.1, not localhost)
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Server (.env in server/ directory):**

The file already exists, you just need to update these values:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
```

**Client (.env in client/ directory):**

Already configured! No changes needed for local development.

## 4. Start the Application

**You need TWO terminal windows:**

### Terminal 1 - Start the Server:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 - Start the Client:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The app will automatically open at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `http://localhost:3000`

## 5. Test It Out!

### As a Host:
1. Click "Host a Game"
2. Log in with Spotify (Premium account required)
3. Enter your display name
4. Select a playlist
5. Share the room code with friends

### As a Player:
1. Open the app in another browser/tab
2. Click "Join a Game"
3. Enter your name and the room code

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Checkpoint 0:** Project setup and configuration
✅ **Checkpoint 1:** Beautiful homepage with host/join options
✅ **Checkpoint 2:** Spotify OAuth authentication (hosts only)
✅ **Checkpoint 3:** Real-time room management with Socket.io
✅ **Checkpoint 4:** Lobby UI with player list
✅ **Checkpoint 5:** Playlist selection and Spotify Web Playback SDK
✅ **Checkpoint 6:** Core gameplay loop (buzz-in, guessing, judging)
✅ **Checkpoint 7:** Scoring system and win conditions
✅ **Checkpoint 8:** Polish, animations, and error handling

## Architecture Highlights

### Authentication Flow
- Only **hosts** need to authenticate with Spotify
- Players just enter a display name (no login required)
- Secure OAuth 2.0 flow with httpOnly cookies

### Real-Time Communication
- Socket.io for instant updates
- Room-based event broadcasting
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect

### Spotify Integration
- **Server-side:** Fetches playlists and tracks via Spotify Web API
- **Client-side (Host only):** Web Playback SDK for music streaming
- Only the host hears the music (players don't!)

### Game Flow
1. Host selects playlist and starts game
2. Host's browser plays music via Spotify SDK
3. Players race to buzz in (first-come-first-served)
4. Buzzer has 30 seconds to guess
5. Rotating judge decides if guess is correct
6. First to 10 points wins!

## Code Quality Features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Spotify SDK not loaded"**
- The Spotify script is already in `public/index.html`
- Just make sure you're running the client

**"No access token available"**
- Make sure you logged in as a host
- Check your Spotify credentials in server `.env`

**Socket connection failed**
- Verify server is running on port 8080
- Check `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` in client `.env`

**Room not found**
- Double-check the 4-letter code
- Make sure host's session is still active
